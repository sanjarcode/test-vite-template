# React + Vite

I am tired of [create-react-app](https://github.com/sanjar-notes/react/issues/45)

## Using repo as template (optional)

1. Fork this repo to start a new project.
2. Run `npm run fix_package_json_for_current_repo`. This fixes the `homepage` and `name` keys, which are needed for GitHub pages deployment.
3. Check package.json and commit.

## Running

1. `npm install` - install dependencies
2. `npm run dev` - start dev server
3. `npm run predeploy && npm run deploy` - deploy latest commit to github pages

Tip: Use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm) instead of `npm` for even faster installation time.
